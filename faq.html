              <h3>Why on earth would anyone move to Mars?</h3>
              <p>
                The short answer is. Because we can. Why did Columbus travel
                west? Why did Marco Polo head east? Because it is that pull,
                that unknown, that prospect of adventure that compels humans to
                seek new frontiers to explore. <br /><br />
                Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure.
                Imagine living on another planet, millions of miles from the
                Earth; looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one of
                the 'stars' is actually the planet you were born on. Who can
                even envision the incredible feeling of being the first human in
                history to step out of the capsule and leave your footprint on
                the surface of Mars? By this we implore you to not just think of
                that feeling for the astronaut, but the experience for all those
                watching back home. Those who observed Neil Armstrong land on
                the Moon all those years ago still remember every detail â€“ where
                they were, who they were with and how they felt. The moment the
                first astronauts land on Mars will be our moment to remember.
                <br /><br />
                A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity. Where did Mars
                come from? Can it teach us about Earth's history? Is there life
                on Mars? These are just three of the hundreds of burning
                questions for scientists all over the world.

              <h3>Is this trip risky?</h3>
              <p>
                The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any venture in
                any means of travel, there are always things that could go
                wrong. In the case of Mars One, the following risks are
                conceivable:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Accident(s) during launch</li>
                <li>Vital components could malfunction</li>
                <li>There could be problems when landing</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks, if you
                were to compare our mission to the first Moon mission in 1969,
                it quickly becomes apparent that this mission is much safer.

                During the working hours, the astronauts will be busy performing
                three main tasks: construction, maintenance and research.
                Besides work, they will also have time to relax.

              <h3>How long does it take to travel to Mars?</h3>
              <p>
                The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than astronauts
                currently stay on the International Space Station. The precise
                duration of each journey depends on when it is taken. Because
                both Mars and Earth's orbits are not perfectly circular, the
                time it takes to travel between them varies from six to eight
                months. When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel
                time for the astronauts is very important.
